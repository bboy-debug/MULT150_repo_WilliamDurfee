Pick 4 suggestions for enhancing the game from the exercise and add implement them in your project:

General
+ added columns (cylinders) in background
+ added giant balls in background

(Notes: I liked the water aesthetic and wanted to create a background scene that can either be interpreted as sunken ruin will pillars sticking out of the water, or a game show with obstacles similar to Wipeout.)


Bumper
+ added a sphere to the bumper's shape
+ kept the Box Collider 
+ Box Collider covers a slighty larger area
+ added new Footstep Sounds
+ added collision sounds
	+ small sound for Chaos balls
	+ large one for Colored balls

(Notes: I wanted players to identify which type of ball has collided with them. It can be difficult to judge without sound cues due to the balls fast travel speed. I also decided to leave the speed as it is for a provided challenge.)


Timer
+ recycled timer and isRunning scripting from Hour 6

(Notes: now players can aim for high scores!)


Sounds & Music
+ added sounds and music from Super Monkey Ball 2 OST (SEGA).

I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE SUPER MONKEY BALL FRANCHISE (SEGA). This is simply a "for-fun" experiment. Any music and sounds are simply used here for experimentation purposes only.

(Notes: the setting I've created reminds me of a childhood favorite game of mine, Super Monkey Ball 2.)
