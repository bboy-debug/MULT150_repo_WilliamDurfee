1. Is the game to easy or hard? Give 3 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
---------------------------------------
For me, I find the game fairly balanced in difficulty. My problem with this is that the difficulty doesn't change. It is too easy
for more experienced players to endlessly play the game without losing. They are never likely to lose because there's no increasing
difficulty:
- Obstacles don't appear as often as they should overtime. Without an increasing difficulty in dodging obstacles, the game's fun
factor remains stagnant. There's no challenge.
- The speed that powerups and obstacles move don't increase either. Making these slightly more harder to avoid or collect can test
the player's reaction time and skill. However...
-...the player's movement speed is too slow. There's a bit of added weight and momentum the player character has when changing 
direction. In some cases, this could work in some games that focus on movement, but I feel that GauntletRunner should focus more on
speed and reaction time. 


2. What 3 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
---------------------------------------
- Obstacles should increase in numbers overtime. The starting amount is okay, but there should be a constant increase of obstacles
the longer the game is played. This adds difficulty for players who survive the gauntlet longer. More challenge, more excitement.
- Obstacles and powerups should increase in speed overtime. Testing the player's reaction time could test their skills and improve
after multiple play sessions. However, we would also have to...
-...increase the player's movement speed. If we make all the following changes and not support the player character's acceleration
and turning, then obstacles and powerups will be nearly impossible for the player to grab and react to in a fair manner. 


3. List three things that would give it a "wow" factor.
---------------------------------------
- I would add sound effects. I doesn't feel satisfying to collect powerups for there isn't any sound recognition. It feels empty.
- I would add music. Without sounds, the game feels like it doesn't have much of a personality (aside from the visuals). I feel that
adding music would give the game more of an identity.
- I would improve the animation (and speed). The character's running animation is fine, but the speed of the scrolling textures does 
not match the speed of the running animation. I would increase the speed of the character's running animation and the scrolling 
textures so the player feels fast instead of awkwardly running at a snail's pace.


4. What parts of the game are fun? 3 items
---------------------------------------
- Collecting powerups to get a time increase is almost satisfying, however there's barely any recognition via sound or visual when
obtaining one.
- Timing a well-placed "phaseOut" ability right before hitting an obstacle can bring some enjoyment. Nearly getting hit by damage in a
video game can feel really exciting.
- The colors are fun. The "cyberpunk-like" theme is fairly entertaining (perhaps adding more decor to that theme could really
"sell" the game's atmosphere...)


5. What parts of the game are tedious? 3 items
---------------------------------------
- As previously mentioned, the game's too easy. The difficulty never increases, so repeating the same tasks without any extra
challenge can be boring.
- Players don't like to be slowed, although I can kinda excuse the obstacles as that is their intentional design. Still, I'd
rather lose health in a game than having my mobility constantly being slowed down everytime I make an error.
- The "phaseOut" ability is ALMOST pointless. I've never found a reason to use it to dodge obstacles, as I can easily move out of the
way by simply moving left of right (perhaps adding a new obstacle that requires the player to use the "phaseOut" ability could
add some extra challenge and utility for the ability...)

Personal Notes:
- character run animation too slow (pg365-367)
- floor material moves too slow
